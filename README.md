# Catcus Catcher
Catcus-Catcher is a 2D endless runner game where the player controls a dinosaur that continuously runs forward on a scrolling ground. The player can make the dino jump by pressing the spacebar or clicking the mouse to avoid randomly spawned obstacles. Gravity is applied to create a natural jump and fall effect, and the dino can only jump again once it's grounded. The game becomes progressively more challenging as obstacle speed and spawn rate increase over time. The dino is animated using cycling sprites to bring it to life, while the ground texture scrolls to simulate motion. A scoring system increases based on how far the player survives, and the current score is displayed along with the high score, which is saved between sessions using PlayerPrefs. If the dino hits an obstacle, the game ends, the score is displayed, and the player has the option to restart the game. Clean and modular scripts handle player movement, obstacle spawning, collision detection, and UI updates, making the game easy to manage and extend. With simple controls, increasing difficulty, and an addictive gameplay loop, Dino Runner is a fun and fast-paced Unity project perfect for casual play.
